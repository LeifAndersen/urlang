Racket to JavaScript Compiler
=============================

This collection contains a compiler that hopefully
will evolve into a compiler that can compile Racket
programs into JavaScript programs.

The real Racket runtime is *huge* so it is is doubtful,
that all corners of Racket will be covered. However
I hope to the compiler eventually will be able to
compile a large subset of all Racket programs.

The status so far:

    - no continuation marks
    - no exceptions

The runtime library is in "runtime.rkt".
See the complete list of support data structures
and implemented functions in the source.

On JavaScript implementations that support (JavaScript) TCO the output
of the compiler ought to handle (Racket) tail calls properly.
